# CitiBike_Geospatial_Analysis
[Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/) is NYC's bike share system and the largest in the nation. It launched in May 2013 with 6,000 bike at 332 stations throughout Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. Today, it grows to 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations around the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Jersey City.

However, increased ridership and unpredictable commuting patterns during the pandemic have made it hard to distribute bikes and stations due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity in demand. As Citi Bike publishes [downloadable files](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) of Citi Bike trip data for the public, we plan on telling more stories via data analysis and visualisation based on muliti-source data.
