# CitiBike_Analysis
[Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/) is NYC's bike share system and the largest in the nation. It launched in May 2013 with 6,000 bike at hundreds of stations throughout Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. Today, it grows to 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations around Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Jersey City.

However, the temporal and spatial heterogeneity in demand for bicycles is obvious. As Citi Bike publishes [downloadable files](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) of Citi Bike trip data fpr the public, we plan on telling more stories via data analysis and visualisation.
